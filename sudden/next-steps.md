Okay, so I'm just putting my thoughts on what else can be done for this Java project. We are actually creating a trading journal, so we have a very minimal boilerplate code now that includes all the controllers, services, and the model classes. But the major challenge is that we need to improve our authentication systems. We need to find a way to implement an authentication system possibly using JWT. We should implement the user management module and create the REST API endpoints for this particular service. We should ideally include a logging framework as well. These are all the major things that need to be accomplished for this project to be functional.
